# Temperature-Converter
Hey Guys, Prathmesh Ghate Here, I am a Data Science and Python enthusiast.In this project I've made a Temperature Converter. <br> 

I've developed this project using python. <br> 
The Idea behind it was to make ease of converting the temperature and not need to calculate everytime manually. <br> 
As the name itself suggest it helps you and me to convert temperature from 'Fahrenheit' to 'Celsius' and vice versa. <br>
